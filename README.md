## Getting Started
CUDI is a isometric action game split between two styles. At first, the player starts in a eerily empty village with only one person in it. The emtyness is contrasted by the vibrance of the art style and layout of the town lush with trees and habitated by animals. Once you enter your house and go on the bed a dream sequence starts, putting the player in the midths of a dungeon. The dungeon is infested with enemies: Skeletons, Rats, and Goblins, all attempting to destriy you. The player must find the exit to the maze while staying alive to finish the game

### Roadmap
